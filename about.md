So you found my little corner of the Internet where I pour out my soul in proses, poetry and photographs.

Nah. That doesn't sound like me - this is just a place for me to play around with a [Jekyll Now](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2014/08/build-blog-jekyll-github-pages/) / [Lanyon](https://github.com/poole/lanyon) / [Hyde](https://github.com/poole/hyde) blog before I get bored with it and go back to Wordpress.

### About me

During the day I work as a software tester, which means either:
1. I crush software developer's hopes and dreams into tiny itty bitty pieces, by pointing out all the problems in the product we are building the day before they want to ship it...or...
2. I try to help people think about how to build quality into what they are designing, building and testing. 

The truth is probably somewhere between the two.

The rest of the time I try to distract  the pedantic, fault-finding part of myself by shooting arrows, taking photographs, playing with technology and jogging. 


### Contact me

If you want to get hold of me, the best place is a DM on Twitter where I go by [@whatie](https://m.twitter.com/whatie)
