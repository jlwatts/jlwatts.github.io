Got the Pixel 3a today.

# Why?
* Smaller size and a better camera than the Samsung Note 9, which is a bit of a brick and the camera seems distorted for some portrait photoso.
* It's supported by Moment lens
* It run Google stock so is always up to day

# Worries
* Camera nightsight - seen a few poor reviews
* Slower processor might grind on Adobe Lightroom - so far just saving a 2m rotated videi look a while
