# Points to note
 **Still a begineer** - there are lots of things you don't know and need to sort out:
* Get familiar with your equipments stats - riser size, limb length, draw weight, brace height, number of twists in the string, and so on.  Not knowing these when you have spend a few hundred on equipment makes you look a little foolish.
* Not forgetting things like your finger tab / bracer / quiver belt
* Line up on the target - this is harder than you  think when the target is 30 meters away
* Remembering proper form
** Relaxed hand on the bow
** Pushing with your bow
** Pointing with your thumb
** Anchoring correctly
** Drawing elbow high
** Don't collapse your arms
** Don't move your hand away from your face but follow through on release
* 30m is a long way
* Rome wasn't built in a day and everything will take time
