OBeen doing this a few months now and I suck.  Dropped the sights and went barebow, mostly shooting at 20m.  However, most of the arrows go in at the two o'clock position.  
Tried shooting at 30m and 50% fell low, but for some reason inline.  Also have developed the annoying habit of hitting my nose with the string a few times a session.

Clearly need more coaching.
