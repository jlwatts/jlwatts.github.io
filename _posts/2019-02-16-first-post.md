Today has been fun
- Tidied house
- Changed all the beds
- Broke window support
- Climbed dodgy ladder to fix window support
- Got Jekyll now working - didn't like layout so took ages to get Lanyon working - mainly because of CNAMES and redirection issues (4G is okay - wifi is still suffering)
- Fixed hob ignition  (turn off for 10 minutes and then turn on again)
- Cinema with C1 (Lego Movie 2 - pretty )
- Sorted C1's veruca out (really fun)
- All this whilst feeling a bit ill - Jog yesterday was HARD - Monday might be worse.  Have to see.
- Watched ST Discovery S2E4

Need to fix
- Category list on site
- Categories/tags on pages
- Where do images come from?
- Better Windows editor
- Mobile Editor
- There will be more
